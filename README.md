# Classboard

This app will eventually contain lots of utilities for use in my Iron Yard RoR class. For now, it has a help queue,
which will be of great help in the future.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tiy-durham-q3-rails/classboard.git
cd classboard
rake db:migrate
rails server
```
